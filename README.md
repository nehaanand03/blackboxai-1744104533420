# Music Library

## Project Overview
The Music Library project is a simple TypeScript application that manages a collection of songs. Each song has associated metadata, including its title, artist, duration, and a URL to the music file. This project serves as a demonstration of how to structure and export data in TypeScript.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd music-library
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
The `songs.ts` file exports an array of song objects and a `Song` interface that defines the structure for each song. You can import this data into your TypeScript files for further manipulation or display.

Example usage:
```typescript
import { songs } from './songs';

console.log(songs);
```

## Features
- **TypeScript Interface**: Define the structure of a song using the `Song` interface.
- **Song Collection**: A predefined list of songs with attributes like title, artist name, duration, and media URLs.
- **Easy Integration**: Import the songs and use them in other parts of your application easily.

## Dependencies
No external dependencies are listed in the provided `package.json` file. However, make sure that you have TypeScript installed in your environment to compile and run the TypeScript files.
